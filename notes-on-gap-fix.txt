problem: 
	On chrome, there was a white gap between section-title and the parent div
	
	this was probably caused by the way chrome handles borders and the child divs
	
	the child div does inherit the parent's width, but not the width including the parent's borders
	
	same thing happens on Firefox
	
	but Firefox makes the child's width fit perfectly within the parent's borders so there is no gap
	
	Not true on Chrome
	
	That meant we couldn't layer section-title on top of col and have it look seamless
	
	
	fix is a bit silly but it works
	
	
	turned col into a flex container
	
	col's flex items are section-title, section-items, and a section-filler to fill up the empty space
	
	this removes the gap 
	
	section-items and section-filler now display the border we wanted
	
	col used to display the border but is now blank
	
	this allows section-title to inherit the right width from col
	
	----------------
	
	
	the flexbox layout is as follows
	
	#columns is a flexbox, contains four cols, laid out in a row with wrap turned on
	
	each col is 50% width of the page, which means there's 2 to a row, witih 2 rows total
	
	within each col is a flexbox containing the section-title (a solid color box with text)
	
	and also contains section-items (the menu listing for that section) plus a stupid div which
	
	acts as our filler for the empty space
	
	the columns flexbox ensures each col in a row has the same height
	
	the filler helps keep the border box for each col to be the same size too, even if the text in
	one column is less than the text in the adjacent column
	
	the filler works by appearing at the end of items and grows to fill the remaining vertical space
